# Surfs Up Analysis

### Overview of Project

We are determining based on the data that was given to us we are determining if a store front that does ice cream and surfing is sustainable year-round in Oahu. However, we are focusing how two specific months for this analysis which are June and December.

### Results

As we look at June and December numbers below we can clearly see that June numbers all around are much high as expected as June is the right in the middle of summer. As for December numbers are are just slighly lower as we are still comparing two months where the average climate is much more higher then other countries no matter what time of the year. But if we look at June numbers we can see that there is a bit more data being collected for the month of June which could cause the data to be a bit off.
